# Python

In this repository, I have added the basics of python libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib,etc., for performing operations with datasets.

**Numpy** - A Python library used for adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

**Pandas** - A Python library written for data manipulation and analysis.

**Matplotlib** - Its an extension of NumPy library used for plotting and visualizing the results.
